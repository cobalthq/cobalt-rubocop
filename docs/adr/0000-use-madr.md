## Context and Problem Statement

Context and options are well described in the RFC linked above.

## Decision Outcome

As a solution we to use a template similar to the one in [madr](https://github.com/adr/madr) project.

As any documentation method the outcome largely depends on the adoption rather than on the tool itself.
